<hr/>
# WELCOME TO KEPLOY

Hello! We are thrilled to announce that **Keploy** will be applying as a **GSoD** mentoring org for 2023! We are excited to welcome all technical writers to apply for contributing towards ***Keploy's Docs*** during this season! We love mentoring folks and help them get involved in the field of Open Source, tech and docs. If Keploy gets accepted for `GSoD 2023`, we would create task lists and basis of that select folks to contribute during the period. And even without `GSoD`, we always welcome folks to get involved ‚ù§Ô∏è!

**Keep an eye out on this page as we update with more project ideas.**

## About Keploy

Keploy is a functional testing toolkit for developers. It generates E2E tests for APIs (KTests) along with mocks or stubs(KMocks) by recording real API calls. KTests can be imported as mocks for consumers and vice-versa.

Merge KTests with unit testing libraries(like Go-Test, JUnit..) to track combined test-coverage.

KMocks can also be referenced in existing tests or use anywhere (including any testing framework). KMocks can also be used as tests for the server.

You can read more about Keploy from [here](https://docs.keploy.io/docs/keploy-explained/introduction).

## About GSoD
Google Season of Docs (GSoD) is a unique program that brings together technical writers and open source communities to work collaboratively on improving project documentation. It is an initiative by Google that aims to improve the state of documentation within the open source community.

During the program, technical writers are paired with open source communities that are looking to enhance their documentation. The writers collaborate with community mentors to identify areas of improvement, document new features, and provide better explanations of existing features. The program encourages collaboration and communication between technical writers and community members, fostering a strong relationship between the two.

GSoD provides an opportunity for open source communities to benefit from the skills and expertise of technical writers, who bring a fresh perspective to the project. Technical writers, in turn, gain valuable experience in open source software development and contribute to the greater good of the community.

The program runs for several months, during which time technical writers work closely with community members to complete documentation tasks. The ultimate goal is to improve the documentation of the project, making it more accessible to users and developers alike. Overall, GSoD helps to create a more vibrant and thriving open source community by promoting collaboration, improving documentation, and enhancing the user experience.

## Keploy's Participation

We at Keploy believe that clear and comprehensive documentation is essential to the success of any open source project, as it helps users understand the project's features and functionalities, and how to contribute to it. Given Keploy is a developer tool, it becomes all the more essential to have a clear and concise documentation so that developers and testers can easily understand Keploy's core principals and can integrate and work with Keploy with ease. A better documentation becomes ever more important for us as we have a number of integrations and would definitely not want any developer or tester to sit back and keep scratching their heads to make Keploy work (not that it presently the case, but still better documentation is always better, rightüòÖ?)

We look to participate in Google Season of Docs (GSoD) because we recognize the value of technical writing as a critical aspect of the development process. By engaging with technical writers, we can benefit from their expertise and collaborate on improving our documentation, making it more user-friendly and accessible to a wider audience.

At Keploy, we believe that open source is more than just a software development model; it's a community-driven approach to building software. We see GSoD as an opportunity to strengthen our community by fostering collaboration between technical writers and Keploy community members. This will not only enhance our documentation but also help create a welcoming and inclusive environment that encourages contributions from all kinds of contributors.

In summary, participating in GSoD aligns with our values of open source, community engagement, and accessibility. We believe that working with technical writers will enhance our documentation, improve the user experience, and build a stronger community around our project. ***We are excited and hope to be part of this program and look forward to collaborating with technical writers to make Keploy an even better testing framework‚ú®!***


## Projects

1. <b>Add 'Supported JWT Middlewares' to [Go Docs](https://github.com/keploy/docs/tree/main/docs/go)</b>. The reference can be taken from https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/keploy/go-sdk#readme-supported-jwt-middlewares and you can add the same to the Go Docs in the docs repo.
Mentors: Sanskriti Harmukh, Diganta Kr Banik and Barkatul

2. <b>Improve Contribution Guide for Keploy SDK</b>. 
Currently, the contribution guide for Keploy's SDK just has a video refernce to Keploy and a HLD for Java. 
You can take reference from the exisitng video and diagrams and construct a guided contribution guide based for the [SDK repo](https://github.com/keploy/keploy).
Mentors: Ankit Kumar and Jyotirmoy Roy

3. <b>Add References Page for Keploy Variables</b>. 
Currently, the guide for Keploy's SDK just has no references to the Variables that user can set in addition to ``KEPLOY_MODE``. These Variables are mentioned under configs in [Server Code](https://github.com/keploy/keploy/blob/f9e65515e65a58dd18572564610cb41c55ee8de5/server/server.go#L53).
Mentors: Animesh Pathak

**Keep an Eye Out üëÄ as we add more Projects! We would be happy to review any ideas that you may have to improve our docs!**

## Project Scope

1. <b>Scope for Adding 'Supported JWT Middlewares' to Go Docs</b>: The project would  explain the integration , which is lacking in case of the original doc in pkg.go.dev. Out of scope for this would include simply copying the entire documentation from pkg.go.dev and adding it to our docs.

2. <b>Scope for improving contribution guide for Keploy SDK</b>: The scope includes a detailed guide to install Keploy on local machine and then tackle the issue to be solved (step by step guide would also include what problems one might face while setting up the environment and known methods to tackle the common errors). Out of Scope for this project would include adding more video content to explain the working of the SDK.

## Measuring Project's Success
We will measure the success of projects in two halves. 
Firstly, we will use git's workflow issue(if technical writers want to add any) followed by pull requrest followed by discussions on the pull request and then finally merging. 
For the second half, we will try to get user reviews as to if they found the changes helpful and if they were able to get their tasks done following the documenttion. To do this we would leverage our slack channel and try to get reviews from our users.

## Timeline

The project considering the three ideas, on a whole is expected to be completed within four months. The first few weeks would be used to help the technical writers get accustomed with Keploy and understand what Keploy does so that they can use the information while preparing and updating the documentations. Once the technical writers are selected for our project, we expect them to suggest a timeline within which they expect to complete their tasks.

## Project Budget
If our project proposal is accepted, we will have seven mentors who will work across all three project ideas. In order to support our team, we would like to request a total grant of USD 14000 from Google. We plan to distribute USD 4000 of this grant among the technical writers working on each project, and allocate an additional USD 200 towards awarding swags to the technical writers as a token of appreciation.

| Budget item      | Total Amount (in USD) | 
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| Technical Writer achives the task of adding 'Supported JWT Middlewares' to Go Docs| 4000|
| Technical Writer achives the task of improving Contribution Guide for Keploy SDK | 4000         |
|Add 'References' of Keploy Variables | 4000 |
| Swags/T-Shirts   | 200             |
| TOTAL            |     10000          |
