# Google Summer of Code'24 Participant Guide

## **Communication**

Welcome to the Keploy GSoC projects page. We encourage candidates to come up with their own project idea.

Join our [Slack Channel](https://join.slack.com/t/keploy/shared_invite/zt-12rfbvc01-o54cOG0X1G6eVJTuI_orSA) and stay tuned for updates.

Use our [Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QSSs4vPvn_tPeJkhwDuJ9YLSXdtygob9cPc-5yXj3pY/edit?usp=sharing) for the proposal. We recommend the use of google docs for the proposal.


## **General suggestions and warnings**
_________________

- **Project ideas describe the goals we want to achieve
  but may miss details that have to be defined during the project**:
  we expect students to do their own research, propose solutions and be
  ready to deal with uncertainty and solve challenges that
  will come up during the project

- **Code and prototypes are preferred over detailed
  documents and unreliable estimates**:
  rather than using your time to write a very long
  application document, we suggest to invest in writing a prototype
  (which means the code may be thrown out entirely) which will help you
  understand the challenges of the project you want to work on; your
  application should refer to the prototype or other Github contributions
  you made to Keploy that show you have the capability to succeed in the
  project idea you are applying for.

- **Students who have either shown to have or have shown to be
  fast learners for the required hard and soft skills by
  contributing to Keploy have a lot more chances of being accepted**:
  in order to get started contributing refer to the
  :doc:`Keploy Contributing Guidelines <keploy/keploy/contributing.md>`

- **Get trained in the projects you want to apply for**: once
  applicants have completed some basic training by
  :doc:`contributing to Keploy <keploy/keploy/contributing.md>`
  we highly suggest to start working on
  some aspects of the project they are
  interested in applying: all projects
  listed this year are improvements
  of existing modules so these modules
  already have a list of open issues
  which can be solved as part of your advanced training.
  It will also be possible to complete some of the tasks listed in
  the project idea right now before GSoC starts.
  We will list some easy tasks in the project idea for this purpose.

### 4. vs code and other editors extension
**Mentors**: Sarthak Shyngle, Animesh Pathak

**Goals & Ideas:**

1. **Cross-Platform Extension Deployment:**
   - **Objective:** Develop VS Code and IntelliJ extensions fetching the latest Keploy binary, adapting to system architecture using Docker when native support is lacking (e.g., macOS, Windows).
   - **Tech Details:** Platform-specific logic and Docker integration for versatile deployment.

2. **Streamlined Keploy CLI Operations:**
   - **Objective:** Enhance UX by integrating and managing Keploy's CLI operations within the extension, potentially using config files.
   - **Tech Details:** Golang backend for unified CLI command execution within the extensions.

3. **Extension as Keploy API Client for Recording and Replay:**
   - **Objective:** Enable the extension to act as a client for seamless API calls to Keploy, facilitating recording and replaying.
   - **Tech Details:** JavaScript-built client with defined API endpoints for interaction.

4. **Interactive UI Elements with Widgets and Buttons:**
   - **Objective:** Create an intuitive UI in VS Code and IntelliJ with widgets and buttons for user-friendly Keploy proxy server interaction.
   - **Tech Details:** HTML, CSS, and web technologies for embedded UI elements.

5. **Marketplace Deployment and Continuous Integration (CI):**
   - **Objective:** Deploy extensions to VS Code Marketplace and implement a CI pipeline for automated testing, versioning, and releases.
   - **Tech Details:** Standard CI/CD practices, utilizing VS Code Marketplace for distribution.

These technical advancements aim to deliver a seamless and efficient user experience, making Keploy integration more accessible across diverse development environments.

**Time Estimate** : 200 hours

**Difficulty** : Medium 

**Task List** :

|      |       |       |            |


### 5. Add support for Windows native
Currently, keploy requires a docker to capture the API calls from the application conatiner. It is able to capture the incoming/outgoing network for linux native using the eBPF feature of linux. So to add support for windows, keploy should redirect the incoming/outgoing requests to the transparent proxy.
**Mentors**:
Ritik Jain,
**Goals & Ideas**
* Deploy the IP Routing for windows, to reroute network traffic towards the designated proxy server.
* Develop a TCP server capable of processing HTTP and HTTPS requests directed at the application, ensuring efficient and secure data transmission.
* Integrate dependency parsers to manage and interpret outgoing requests generated by the user's application, enhancing the application's ability to interact with external services.
* Implement the logic to simulate the recorded incoming calls using the  transparent proxy in test mode.
* Implement TLS support for outgoing calls within the user's application, enabling the capture or simulation of secure communications for testing and development purposes.
**Skills Required**
* Golang
* C
